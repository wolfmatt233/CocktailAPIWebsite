## Project Information

- This application concerns the usage of Firebase, an API, and CRUD.
- The idea is that cocktails will be displayed from an API and users can add them to favorites, and write reviews on them.
- Users can sign up, log in, log out, and delete their accounts.
- A user page will be generated to have statistics on their favorites ingredients and type of drinks
- WARNING: Some drink names may be offensive in nature.
